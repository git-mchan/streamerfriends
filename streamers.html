          <span>The following questions were asked:</span>
          <br />
          <span>
            1. How often do you stream? How long do you usually stream?
          </span>
          <br />
          <span>
            2. How do you prefer to showcase yourself and why? How did you feel
            using any of these types if applicable? (PNGTuber, Vtuber, real face
            cam, etc)
          </span>
          <br />
          <span>
            3. If you’ve used multiple types of avatars, which one do you think
            your viewers preferred? would you use it more if your viewers liked
            it best even if it’s out of your comfort zone?
          </span>
          <br />
          <span>4.&nbsp;What are the types of things you stream?</span>
          <br />
          <span>
            5.&nbsp;What is your goal(s) when streaming? Some Ex. To meet new
            people; Something to do like a hobby; Create a community unique to
            you… etc
          </span>
          <br />
          <span>
            6.&nbsp;Since I’m mainly doing research on spycant, chanreee,
            addddistar, which are all friends. Would you say your communities
            intertwine with each other or are completely different? What would
            you say about the vibes about each other’s community, including your
            own.

              occasional family member in the background. I also feel shy about
              my appearance, especially when I’m playing games. I feel more

              stream. I feel like vibez of caring for the streamer is similar

              community, chanreee has a more chill and troll community, and I
